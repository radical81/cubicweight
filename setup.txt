Setup instructions:
by Rex Jason Alobba

This command-line program was written in Python 2.7.10.

Unirest for Python needs to be installed via pip for the program to work.

The program uses dependency libraries. The dependencies are as follows:
1. threading
2. unirest
3. json
4. string
5. sys

The assumption is that this program is run via command-line with Internet access. Another assumption is that this program is executed by the user with write-access to the folder the program is saved in, a .pyc file is generated whenever the program is executed.

It needs one command-line argument, the Category. If the Category is more than one word, it may be enclosed in double quotes. A sample usage in a nix terminal would be:

$ python cubicweight.py "air conditioners"

There are also unit tests in this program that can be invoked by command-line:

$ python testCalculator.py
